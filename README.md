This is the initial version of PHP USSD SDK. 

The general idea and intention is to:

1. Have a skeleton for creation of robust USSD applications to be extended by Devolopers

2. Create a UI for creation of MENU logic by non-technical users

3. Create generic validations for inputs and also error reporting

4. Expose an API for data migration and importation from other systems

5. Create scripts for connection to a number of USSD Gateway providers


I hope to document and support this code and welcome you to join in. Feel free to email me on le-yo@le-yo.com
